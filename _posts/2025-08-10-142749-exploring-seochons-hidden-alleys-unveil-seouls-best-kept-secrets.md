#### Discover the charm behind the hustle: A journey through the less-traveled paths of my childhood

Every guidebook tells you to visit Gyeongbok Palace, but let me take you on a stroll through my childhood playground‚Äîthe winding, art-filled alleys of Seochon. This quaint neighborhood, located just west of the grand palace, is where the heart of Seoul's local culture beats quietly, away from the tourist throngs.

### üåø Rediscover Seoul: Beyond Gyeongbok Palace

While Gyeongbok Palace is undeniably majestic, stepping into Seochon offers a glimpse into the daily lives of locals. Growing up, I remember the old hanok (traditional Korean houses) that line the streets, each telling stories of yesteryears through their weathered wooden doors. Today, many of these hanoks have transformed into charming cafes, galleries, and boutiques. Start your exploration at Tongin Market, an authentic local market where you can trade old Korean coins for a tray of various street foods‚Äîperfect for a family snack while exploring.

### üé® Art Lover's Hideaway: Seochon's Galleries

Seochon is not just about its alleys but also the vibrant art scene hidden within them. As a kid, I watched artists set up their easels, capturing the essence of our serene neighborhood. Now, galleries like Daelim Museum and the smaller, independent galleries tucked away in unassuming spots offer a feast for the senses. They're usually less crowded, so you and the kids can enjoy the art at your own pace, discussing colorful paintings without having to raise your voice over a crowd.

### üç≤ Where to Eat: A Local‚Äôs Guide to Dining

No visit to Seochon is complete without indulging in the local cuisine. Avoid the main streets and duck into any modest eatery in the alleys for an authentic taste of Seoul. One of my favorite childhood memories is of eating piping hot tteokbokki (rice cakes in chili sauce) from a small corner shop that's still there, hidden from the usual tourist path. The shop is cozy enough to navigate with a stroller and offers a variety of dishes that cater to both adventurous and cautious young palates.

### üåÜ Best Time to Visit: Catching Seochon's Magic Hour

There‚Äôs a particular time of day that the locals cherish, which tourists often miss‚Äîdusk. As the sun sets, the hanok rooftops are bathed in a golden glow, and the alleys take on a magical feel. It‚Äôs a perfect time for a gentle stroll with the family, as the day cools down and the lanterns start to light up, guiding your path through this enchanting neighborhood.

Seochon's hidden alleys are more than just shortcuts through the neighborhood; they are pathways to the soul of Seoul, offering a blend of tradition and modernity at every turn. Whether you're a solo explorer, a couple, or navigating the alleys with a stroller in tow, Seochon welcomes you with open arms and hidden treasures.

So next time you're in Seoul, skip the crowded tourist spots and take a detour into the heart of the city as it is lived and loved by those who know it best‚Äîits locals. Dive into the authentic experiences and create memories that are truly unique, just like the hidden alleys of Seochon.
